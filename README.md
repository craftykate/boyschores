## To Do

* ~~Be able to delete chores from available list~~
* ~~Show notes~~
* ~~Add required chores~~
* Ability to "start a new day" - erase all their completed chores and undo any completed required chores
* Input somewhere what the daily goal is so when a boy reaches it their chart turns a different color or something
* Add authentication - this will come a little later when I publish the site to the interwebs
  * This also comes along with making some content only visible to me, as opposed to the boys
  * After adding authentication, add ability to deactivate - but not delete - chores. So they aren't active now, but are saved in a grayed out state only I can see for the future
